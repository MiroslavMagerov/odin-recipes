                    <h3>What Makes These The World's Best Pork Chops?</h3>
                    <p>There might not be an actual award given to pork chops, but if there was, this 5-ingredient dish would surely win it thanks to the sauce alone. Reviewers rave about the ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic glaze that is brushed onto the chops on the grill.
                    In fact, many reviewers suggest marinating the pork chops in the glaze first, brushing them with more glaze on the grill, and making an extra batch of sauce to serve on the side for dipping because it's just that good.</p>

                            <h4>Step 1</h4>
                            <p>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Gather ingredients.</p>
                        </li>

                            <h4>Step 2</h4>
                            <p>Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Step 3</h4>
                            <p>Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p>
